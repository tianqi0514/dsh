WorkDSH adds a **local Library, skills, experts, connectors, team activity, browser/computer use, and editable Office deliverables** to the native NexusOne task experience. You stay in one conversation while the work appears beside it as a real document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF, webpage, or connected-service result.

Think of it as an **independent open-source alternative for a WorkBuddy-style workflow**: assign a real job, watch the work unfold, intervene when needed, and receive editable artifacts. WorkDSH is built independently for NexusOne and is not an official WorkBuddy release.

![WorkDSH creating and presenting a real HTML analysis dashboard](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-html-dashboard-preview.png)

*Real local preview: the conversation, delivered files, and an editable HTML dashboard remain in the same task. Example data and costs belong to the user's test workspace.*

## Start with one real task

Attach your material and ask in plain language:

> Review this budget workbook. Flag every missing assumption, show the findings in a dashboard, and deliver the HTML file.

WorkDSH can keep the source material, model conversation, live result, revisions, and final file together. You can inspect the work, edit it yourself, then ask the AI to continue from the latest saved version.

Already using the Harness `0.1.6-alpha.2` Web Profile? Install the modules you need from [Releases](https://github.com/techflag/workdsh/releases), or jump to the [quick start](#quick-start). WorkDSH uses the official `dsh plugin` lifecycle rather than a second runtime.

## What it gives you

| You need | WorkDSH behavior | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A report, brief, or dashboard | Reads the task material, writes in visible batches, and keeps revisions | Editable HTML, Word, PDF, or Markdown working copy within the supported format scope |
| A presentation | Creates or imports a PPTX working copy, edits slides, and keeps human changes | Editable PPTX with download; complex-template fidelity still requires review |
| A spreadsheet | Opens a workbook beside the task and preserves supported values and formulas | Editable XLSX working copy with format-specific limits |
| Knowledge capture and reuse | Stores Markdown, text, HTML, PDF, Word, and PPT files locally; browses folders, searches full text, and previews originals | A reusable personal Library whose selected revisions can be sent directly into a new conversation |
| Repeatable expertise | Installs or creates Markdown skills with resources; experts pin reviewed revisions | Reusable skills and explicit expert identities instead of one-off prompts |
| Connected services | Adds independent MCP instances, keeps credentials in the official credential service, and selects tools per conversation | A visible connector name beside the prompt and only that connector's MCP namespace in the task |
| Team execution | Shows the team, members, active state, and task activity in the conversation | A visible collaboration trail; complete TM-01 real-model acceptance is still in progress |

## Local Library 0.1

![WorkDSH local Library with an original HTML preview](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-library-preview.png)

The Library turns task outputs and reference files into local knowledge that can be searched, previewed, and supplied to the model again. It supports folders, recent items, and full-text search; retains original files; and produces deterministic text for Markdown, TXT, HTML, PDF, DOCX, and PPTX content.

- Selecting a file or folder creates a **fixed-revision** reference in a new conversation, so later edits cannot silently change content already sent to the model.
- Enter `/skill-name` in that conversation to combine a Skill's method with the selected Library material; this composition path is covered by an integration test.
- HTML and Markdown preview directly. With the Office plugin installed, Word and PPT also receive enhanced original-file previews.
- The current Alpha targets one local user, with move, rename, delete, disabled restore, and a 5 GiB aggregate revision quota. Scanned-PDF OCR and shared team libraries are not included yet.

[Download the Library Alpha](https://github.com/techflag/workdsh/releases/tag/library-v0.1.0-alpha.1) · [Read the Library package guide](packages/plugins/library/README.md)

## What makes WorkDSH different

| Characteristic | What you experience |
| --- | --- |
| **Open-source WorkBuddy-style workflow** | The task, visible process, human checkpoints, and editable result stay together in an implementation you can inspect, install, and extend. |
| **Real deliverables** | Supported outputs are saved as working copies and downloadable files. A failed tool call is never presented as a finished file. |
| **Live human–AI editing** | Open a result, correct it directly, and let the model continue from the latest saved revision. |
| **Reusable local knowledge** | Keep files in folders, search their text, preview originals, and bring fixed revisions into a new conversation together with a Skill. |
| **Reusable professional capability** | Skills carry instructions and resources; experts bind reviewed skill revisions and an explicit identity instead of relying on a one-off role prompt. |
| **Conversation-scoped connectors** | Enable multiple MCP instances globally, then choose exactly which connected service a conversation may use. A new conversation starts with none selected. |
| **Visible team activity** | The conversation can show the expert team, active member, handoff, and task state. Full TM-01 real-model acceptance remains in progress. |
| **Native Harness workflow** | Tasks, models, attachments, permissions, queues, skills, and plugin loading remain owned by Harness; WorkDSH extends public services and UI slots. |
| **Independent plugin delivery** | Skills, experts, Office, activity, governance, and presentation are versioned separately, so a Profile installs only what it needs. |

## Current preview status

The latest public Web preview was verified on **Harness `0.1.6-alpha.2`, Node.js `22.23.2`, and macOS** through packaged installation and cold-start checks. The local Library, Skills, individual experts, MCP connectors, Office working copies, browser/computer use, and collaboration activity are available as alpha modules.

This remains a development preview. Real-model acceptance for complete expert-team workflows, arbitrary Office fidelity, and multi-platform behavior is not finished. The default listener is local; this repository does not claim a production-ready internet-facing multi-tenant deployment. Exact versions, checksums, limits, and evidence are documented below.

## Plugins are the architecture

WorkDSH follows Harness's own extension model: official **Loader + Profile + Cordis**, standard Host/Client entry points, and documented UI Slots. It uses published Harness packages and requires no upstream source checkout.

| Principle | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Install capabilities independently | Skill ships its own configuration layer, Host service, Client module, and prebuilt `.tgz`. The presentation package is optional. |
| Compose through public contracts | Experts reference shared Skills; Library fixed references enter native conversations and can use Office's enhanced preview service. |
| Keep the native runtime | Harness owns conversations, workspaces, model execution, skill discovery and invocation, and plugin loading. WorkDSH contributes management workflows and UI. |
| Version each module separately | Skill stays on its own `0.1` line. A presentation update does not force a Skill version change. |
| Preserve user content | Removing the Skill **plugin** preserves skill files and management data. Uninstalling an individual **skill** uses the recoverable management workflow. |

  profile --> library[Independent Library plugin]
  profile --> presentation[Optional WorkDSH presentation bundle]
  skills --> service[Public Skill management service]
  service --> experts[Independent Experts plugin]
  library --> office[Optional Office preview]
```

A **feature plugin** is an installable software module. A **skill** is a user-managed `SKILL.md` with optional resources. One Skill plugin manages many skills; creating a skill does not require publishing an npm package.

## What Skill 0.1 can do

| Workflow | Available behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Browse | Global local-skill list, search, full `SKILL.md`, resource files, and invalid-skill diagnostics. |
| Create and try | Prepare a native task with `/skill-creator` or `/skill-name`; keep attachments, `/`, `@`, model selection, permissions, and sending. |
| Import | `.zip`, `.md`, or folders; inspect files, validate format and paths, confirm scope, then install atomically. Import does not execute included scripts. |
| Edit | Edit documents and text resources, detect revision conflicts, save, and rediscover. Directory reveal uses the native Host capability. |
| Manage | Enable/disable, check registered dependency impact, batch operations, recoverable uninstall, and restore. |
| Recover | Preserve edits and management state across tested cold restarts; cancel uploads and retry failed imports. |

Workbench `alpha.10` is currently delivered within the presentation bundle. Shared UI, contracts, and the local identity/access/audit foundation are supporting packages, **not standalone end-user downloads**. See the [complete module map](docs/RELEASES.md).

## Quick start

### Install a prebuilt plugin

Use **Node.js 22.19+ on the 22 LTS line, or Node 24+**, **pnpm 10.34.5**, and the official **Harness CLI `0.1.6-alpha.2`**. These commands assume `dsh` resolves to that CLI, rather than an older desktop launcher.

For the complete product, download every asset from [project release `v0.1.0-alpha.6`](https://github.com/techflag/workdsh/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.6) into one directory. The Library is currently a separate prerelease, so also download the [Library Alpha package](https://github.com/techflag/workdsh/releases/tag/library-v0.1.0-alpha.1). Stop the target profile, `cd` to that directory, install the project bundle, then add the Library package separately:

```sh
node install-workdsh.mjs --profile workdsh
dsh --profile workdsh
```

Use `--dry-run` to inspect the commands. The equivalent manual installation is:

```sh
dsh --profile workdsh --from-default-profile web --dump-config
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-provider-identity-local-0.1.0-alpha.5.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-audit-0.1.0-alpha.4.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-access-0.1.0-alpha.5.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-library-0.1.0-alpha.1.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-skills-0.1.0-alpha.30.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-experts-0.1.0-alpha.5.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-connectors-0.1.0-alpha.1.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-activity-0.1.0-alpha.4.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-plugin-office-0.1.0-alpha.7.tgz"
dsh plugin --profile workdsh add "$PWD/workdsh-bundle-0.1.0-alpha.46.tgz"
dsh --profile workdsh
```

Verify the downloads against `SHA256SUMS` first. `workdsh-plugin-experts` composes the official Harness Agent Team Host, nine Team tools, and Client panel; after installation, **Agent Team** appears in the conversation header. Installing only Skills and the presentation bundle does not install Experts, Team, Connectors, or Office.

Open **专家 · 技能 · 连接器** in the sidebar to manage experts, skills, and connectors. Model-backed execution requires your own Harness model configuration.

Follow the official [`dsh plugin … add` flow](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/develop/basic/publish). GitHub's **Source code** archives are source snapshots; install the named `.tgz` assets. Installation and removal are verified with the Host stopped and restarted, not as complete live CLI hot-unload operations.

### Run from the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/techflag/workdsh.git
cd workdsh
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm preview:install
corepack pnpm preview
```

The preview runs at `http://127.0.0.1:18989`; use the authenticated URL printed at startup. It has its own Profile and reads your normal `~/.agents` skills by default. Automated tests use isolated homes. See [development setup](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Roadmap

| Stage | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill 0.1 | Local skill management and independent package delivery | Available on the verified Web baseline. |
| Experts 0.1 | Definitions, drafts, revisions, shared skill references, and task handoff | Alpha available; professional quality and final stability acceptance incomplete. |
| Office 0.1 | Real-file creation, live editing, preview, and export; PPT is the current source-development focus | Alpha available; PPT template and real-model visual acceptance remain in progress. Word feature expansion is paused. |
| Connectors 0.1 | Multiple MCP instances, official credential storage, discovery, lifecycle, and per-conversation selection | Alpha available; token authorization is verified, while interactive OAuth remains future work. |
| Library 0.1 | Local knowledge space, folders, full-text search, original preview, and fixed conversation revisions | Alpha released; the local personal workflow is available, while sharing and OCR remain future work. |
| Following modules | Projects → industry applications → integration | Planned, delivered one module at a time. |
| Enterprise | Server + administration Web + Harness execution nodes; organization skills, categories, versions, access, and rollout | Deferred. No public Skill marketplace, SkillHub, or skill suites in this release. |

See the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md), [expert handoff](docs/design/experts/README.md), and [enterprise ToDo](docs/TODO.md). This preview targets a trusted local user; it is not an internet-facing multi-tenant server.

## Development and documentation

```sh
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test:integration
corepack pnpm test:planning
corepack pnpm check:plan
corepack pnpm check:versions
corepack pnpm probe:skills
corepack pnpm probe:browser
```

Packaged probes exercise actual installation, browser interactions, edits, recovery, removal, and reinstallation. They do not prove real-model quality, enterprise isolation, or compatibility with untested desktop versions.

Feature modules live in `packages/plugins/<domain>`, providers in `packages/providers/<name>`, and shared packages in `packages/{contracts,ui,bundle}`. Scaffolds do not imply installable plugins. See the [package guide](packages/plugins/README.md).

Built on [NexusOne](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/); interaction references include [WorkBuddy](https://www.workbuddy.cn/). WorkDSH is an independent project, not an official product of either team.

## Current development preview

![WorkDSH Skill market development preview](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-skill-market-preview.png)

User-provided screenshot of the current application, showing categories, search, installed-skill management and installation from a local catalog. Third-party skill names and icons belong to their respective providers; they do not demonstrate completed connector integrations. Task names and spending figures are local user state, not bundled defaults.

The current Office development candidate keeps `pptx-react-viewer` as its sole PPT editor, integrated with the native results panel and shared Office content service. It supports incremental slide writing, human editing, native chart data, saved working copies and PPTX download. Chinese UI, template fidelity, and real-model visual quality are still being improved. See [PPT integration evidence](docs/evidence/office-pptx-integration.md).

### HTML and PDF working copies

The current source candidate can open a self-contained HTML page in the native results panel before AI updates its saved revisions. PDF creation supports Chinese text, page updates, preview, manual text changes and actual PDF download/file delivery. PDF rendering uses bundled libraries and an embedded font; end users do not need Python for this PDF workflow. Existing arbitrary PDF import, OCR and image editing are not supported. These additions are source-development features and do not change the older Word-only release archives.

See [HTML working copies](docs/design/office/HTML-LIVE.md) and [PDF working copies](docs/design/office/PDF-LIVE.md) for implementation scope and acceptance boundaries.

#### HTML dashboard generation

![WorkDSH HTML dashboard generation and native preview / HTML 看板生成与原生预览](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-html-dashboard-preview.png)

Generate a self-contained HTML dashboard from task materials, preview the finished page in the native results panel, and receive the HTML files through native deliverable cards. This user-provided screenshot shows a budget dashboard with parameter cards, section navigation and missing-information notices, alongside the delivered dashboard and `index.html` files. It shows local file preview; conversation names, paths and figures belong to this example.

Public expert creation is reusable across domains, with methods, real Skill selection, explicit UI publication and native task trials. Model-generated content still needs user review; synthetic professional evaluations document limitations rather than guaranteeing every answer. See [current evidence](docs/evidence/d04-experts-review-fixes.md).

### Native PPT editing preview

[Office alpha.7 project release and installable archive](https://github.com/techflag/workdsh/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.6)

![WorkDSH 原生 PPT 编辑](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-ppt-live-preview.png)

User-provided application screenshot showing incremental AI slide editing in the native results panel. This existing conversation still contains earlier export guidance; the new PPTX content_export implementation is described in the source and has not yet passed a real-session file-card acceptance test.

[2026-09-14 development-candidate notes](docs/releases/2026-09-14-development-candidate.md)

### Activity and expert teams

![WorkDSH 工作动态与 HTML 实时制作](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-activity-html-preview.png)

A compact activity strip shows the native task state and the current skill, alongside the original conversation and live HTML working copy. Its colored border animates while processing; animations can be disabled and respect reduced-motion preferences. The strip is centered and uses half the available width on wide screens.

![WorkDSH 专家团任务与协作动态](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-team-activity-preview.png)

Expert-team sessions carry the team name and activity state. Member activity appears when native child sessions exist; the team label alone does not prove multiple members are executing. This example shows zero child agents at the captured moment.

![WorkDSH 专家团详情、草稿与成员](docs/assets/screenshots/workdsh-expert-team-detail-preview.png)

Team details show capabilities, starter requests, the lead and members. Saved drafts remain separate from published revisions; summoning uses the published revision until changes are explicitly published. These are user-provided local preview screenshots, including example task names, paths and spending figures; they document the development candidate rather than the older downloadable releases.

WorkDSH explicitly takes **WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy** as a product-experience reference: a real task should expose its process and end in an editable artifact. Skill-market organization, grouped toolbars, and PPT design guidance also draw on those experiences. WorkDSH is an independent open-source implementation for NexusOne; it does not reuse WorkBuddy branding or claim an official partnership, endorsement, or Tencent PPT engine integration.
